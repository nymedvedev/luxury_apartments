## About The Project

<p>The purpose of this work was to <b>create a 1 in 1 website based on the <a href="https://github.com/nymedvedev/luxury_apartments_project/blob/main/template%20-%20homepage.jpg?raw=true" alt="Template">template</a></b> (that you can view in the file list of repo).</p>

The header of the site contains links to all apartments, apartment reviews, company information, contact information and the "Call me back" button.

The content part contains images and brief descriptions of rental properties (prices are indicated), the "all apartments" button, two user reviews, the "all reviews" button.

The basement part duplicates the main menu from the header, and also contains a physical address, buttons-links to social networks, and legal links.

All icons and logos, as well as photos of apartments are made using sprites.
